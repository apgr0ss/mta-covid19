# Urban mobility in a time of crisis: The impact of COVID-19 on subway ridership

This analysis intends to examine how movement has changed in cities since the outbreak of COVID-19. Specifically, I will be examining ridership dynamics of New York City's MTA subway system.

**Link to data [here](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)**

The data (released every Saturday since 5 May 2010) provides cumulative entry and exit counts for every turnstile in the system. It covers the previous week on a semi-hourly basis (~every 4 hours).
## Goals
- Derive possible explanation for why urban blacks are disproportionately affected by COVID by looking @ subway ridership
- Does paranoia exist? Look @ stations in predominately Asian neighborhoods (e.g., Flushing) and examine if there's a significant drop in weekend ridership
- More broadly, link station to neighborhood and regress % change in visits on neighborhood characteristics and lagged values
	- Neighborhood characteristics could be median salary, race, age, zoning (commercial, residential, etc.)
